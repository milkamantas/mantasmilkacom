                Designing applications for LiveStats presented a unique set of
                challenges that required an intricate understanding of various
                sports and the nuances of their gameplay. The stakes were high,
                as the data collected was not only critical for performance
                analysis but also pivotal for the live betting market, where
                accuracy and timeliness are paramount.

                <div className={styles.paragraph1}>
                  Each sport has its own set of rules, actions, court sizes, and
                  team roster sizes, which necessitated different approaches to
                  user flows and components. For instance, while a live clock
                  was not critical for American Football LiveStats, it was
                  indispensable for Basketball due to the nature of the game.
                  Similarly, tracking the puck was not required for Ice Hockey,
                  but it was crucial for Basketball.

                  Statisticians heavily rely on muscle memory, and even minor
                  changes in the application could significantly impact their
                  workflow. This made introducing changes a delicate process.
                  Some statisticians were so accustomed to traditional methods
                  that they preferred DOS-style applications for data entry.

                  Understanding the perspective of Sports Information Directors
                  (SIDs) was vital. The challenge was to design applications
                  that not only catered to the unique requirements of each sport
                  but also aligned with the preferences and workflows of the
                  SIDs. Usability patterns played a pivotal role in ensuring
                  data accuracy. In the high-stakes world of betting, where
                  payouts can emerge instantly, there was no room for error.
                  Every click mattered. We had to design the applications in a
                  way that prevented missclicks and ensured that the data sent
                  to the betting department was accurate.

                  Football college games where a team could have 250+ members,
                  posed a challenge in creating a consistent user interface for

                  We streamlined the process of LiveStats discovery to ensure

                  To cover all necessary aspects, we held a comprehensive

                Each sport has its own set of rules, actions, court sizes, and
                team roster sizes, which necessitated different approaches to
                user flows and components. For instance, while a live clock was
                not critical for American Football LiveStats, it was
                indispensable for Basketball due to the nature of the game.
                Similarly, tracking the puck was not required for Ice Hockey,
                but it was crucial for Basketball.

                The LiveStats applications required a unique design approach.
                For AFLS, one of the challenges was creating new patterns for
                entering and selecting player numbers. For IHLS, tracking the
                number of players on the pitch was a unique challenge. Usability
                was prioritized over aesthetics. Feedback from SIDs was
                incorporated to ensure the applications were user-friendly.

                  With our concepts of game flows in place, we facilitated
                  another workshop within our development team. This workshop
                  allowed team members to raise questions, voice concerns, and

                  Once the initial concept was approved by the betting

                  this phase to ensure accuracy and alignment with user needs.
                  This was crucial as we had to get everything right for the set

                The AFLS project was a complex endeavor that required us to
                navigate numerous challenges. We were tasked with understanding
                a completely new sport, meeting tight deadlines, and satisfying
                various stakeholders, all with a team of just ten people. The
                project required us to balance the needs of the client, the
                betting division, and our target users - the statisticians. This
                was no easy task, as multiple stakeholders had their own
                personal agendas that could potentially pull the project in
                different directions.

                One of the unique solutions we developed for AFLS was a
                calculator concept for entering player numbers. This feature was
                based on user feedback and was well-received by the
                statisticians. However, it was just one of many innovative
                solutions we developed to meet the unique challenges of this
                project.

                Ice hockey, while not entirely new to our team, presented its
                own unique set of challenges. We had to thoroughly comprehend
                the intricate details of the sport's rules and exceptions.
                Fortunately, our Project Leader's professional ice hockey
                experience greatly aided our understanding and navigation of
