                Designing applications for LiveStats presented a unique set of
                challenges that required an intricate understanding of various
                sports and the nuances of their gameplay. The stakes were high,
                as the data collected was not only critical for performance
                analysis but also pivotal for the live betting market, where
                accuracy and timeliness are paramount.

                  Each sport has its own set of rules, actions, court sizes, and
                  team roster sizes, which necessitated different approaches to
                  user flows and components. For instance, while a live clock
                  was not critical for American Football LiveStats, it was
                  indispensable for Basketball due to the nature of the game.
                  Similarly, tracking the puck was not required for Ice Hockey,
                  but it was crucial for Basketball.

                  Statisticians heavily rely on muscle memory, and even minor
                  changes in the application could significantly impact their
                  workflow. This made introducing changes a delicate process.
                  Some statisticians were so accustomed to traditional methods
                  that they preferred DOS-style applications for data entry.

                  Understanding the perspective of Sports Information Directors
                  (SIDs) was vital. The challenge was to design applications
                  that not only catered to the unique requirements of each sport
                  but also aligned with the preferences and workflows of the
                  SIDs. Usability patterns played a pivotal role in ensuring
                  data accuracy. In the high-stakes world of betting, where
                  payouts can emerge instantly, there was no room for error.
                  Every click mattered. We had to design the applications in a
                  way that prevented missclicks and ensured that the data sent
                  to the betting department was accurate.

                  The sheer size of team rosters, especially in American
                  Football college games where a team could have 250+ members,
                  posed a challenge in creating a consistent user interface for

                Addressing these challenges required a deep dive into the

                to design that balanced the diverse needs of statisticians with

                  We streamlined the process of LiveStats discovery to ensure

                  stakeholders. This collaborative approach ensured that we
                  considered various perspectives, particularly from statistics

                  Once the initial concept was approved by the betting
                  department, we proceeded to develop wireframes and designs for
                  the apps. We consulted our statisticians periodically during
                  this phase to ensure accuracy and alignment with user needs.
                  This was crucial as we had to get everything right for the set
                  launch date.

                The AFLS project was a complex endeavor that required us to
                navigate numerous challenges. We were tasked with understanding
                a completely new sport, meeting tight deadlines, and satisfying
                various stakeholders, all with a team of just ten people. The
                project required us to balance the needs of the client, the
                betting division, and our target users - the statisticians. This
                was no easy task, as multiple stakeholders had their own
                personal agendas that could potentially pull the project in
                different directions.

                One of the unique solutions we developed for AFLS was a
                calculator concept for entering player numbers. This feature was
                based on user feedback and was well-received by the
                statisticians. However, it was just one of many innovative
                solutions we developed to meet the unique challenges of this
                project.

                Ice hockey, while not entirely new to our team, presented its
                own unique set of challenges. We had to thoroughly comprehend
                the intricate details of the sport's rules and exceptions.
                Fortunately, our Project Leader's professional ice hockey
                experience greatly aided our understanding and navigation of
                these complexities.

                Our approach to the IHLS project mirrored our previous efforts,
                involving the conduct of workshops, research, and ideation
                phases for different user flows. We identified various risk
                touch-points that required careful review and continuously
                worked on improving existing user flows.

                The game itself posed several challenges, such as accurately
                maintaining the time clock and tracking player numbers on the
                pitch. Despite these hurdles, our team was able to devise
                effective solutions that proved beneficial in live games,
                demonstrating our ability to adapt and innovate in the face of
                challenges.

                In my previous role, I was entrusted with the responsibility of
                overseeing the User Experience and Strategy for the entire
                LiveStats family, which encompassed apps for Football,
                Volleyball, and Basketball. This role involved tasks such as
                mapping out user journeys, defining components, and implementing
                accessibility patterns, all aimed at ensuring a consistent user
                experience across all applications.

                One of the significant challenges I encountered was ensuring
                alignment of various elements, such as the game clock and roster
                building, tailored to each specific sport. To overcome this, we
                devised a design system and meticulously mapped experiences
                across applications. This strategic approach guaranteed maximum
                consistency in user flows across all applications.

                demonstrated our efficiency in meeting deadlines and designing
                effective apps. In my role, I also had to think creatively when
                introducing users to new concepts and collaborate with other
                teams to avoid conflicts during development.

                in line with the overall goals and objectives of Genius Sports,

                The projects resulted in the creation of high-fidelity
