                Each sport has its own set of rules, actions, court sizes, and
                team roster sizes, which necessitated different approaches to
                user flows and components. For instance, while a live clock was
                not critical for American Football LiveStats, it was
                indispensable for Basketball due to the nature of the game.
                Similarly, tracking the puck was not required for Ice Hockey,
                but it was crucial for Basketball.

                Ice hockey, while not entirely new to our team, presented its
                own unique set of challenges. We had to thoroughly comprehend
